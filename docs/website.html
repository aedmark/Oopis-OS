|`touch [-c -d 'date'] [file]`|Creates an empty file or updates its timestamp.|
|`rm [-r -f -i] [item]`|Removes (deletes) a file or directory. This is permanent.|
|`cp [-r -f -p -i] [src] [dest]`|Copies a file or directory.|
|`mv [-f -i] [src] [dest]`|Moves or renames a file or directory.|
|`grep [-i -v -n -c -R] [pat]`|Searches for a text pattern within files.|
|`find [path] [expr]`|A powerful tool to find files based on various criteria.|

### Data & System Utilities

|Command & Key Flags|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`head [-n lines] [-c bytes]`|Outputs the first part of a file.|
|`tail [-n lines] [-c bytes]`|Outputs the last part of a file.|
|`diff [file1] [file2]`|Compares two files and shows the differences.|

|`du [-h -s] [path]`|Estimates disk space used by a specific file/directory.|

### Application Suite

OopisOS comes with several built-in applications that run in a full-screen, modal interface, providing a richer experience than standard command-line tools.

- **`explore [path]`** Opens a graphical, two-pane file explorer. The left pane shows an expandable directory tree, and the right pane shows the contents of the selected directory. It's a powerful and intuitive way to navigate your file system.
- **`edit [file]`** Opens the OopisOS text editor. It's a surprisingly capable editor with features like live Markdown and HTML preview (`Ctrl+P`), a formatting toolbar, and keyboard shortcuts for saving (`Ctrl+S`) and exiting (`Ctrl+O`).
- **`paint [file.oopic]`** Unleash your creativity with the character-based art editor. It features a full canvas, multiple tools (pencil, eraser, shapes), a color palette, and saves your work to the custom `.oopic` format.
- **`chidi [path]`** The AI Librarian. Point `chidi` at a directory of Markdown files (`.md`) to open a dedicated reading interface. Here, you can ask the AI to summarize documents, generate study questions, or perform a query across all loaded documents to find specific information. See the full **[Chidi AI Guide](javascript:showSection('chidi'))** for more details.
- **`adventure [file.json]`** Launches the powerful, data-driven text adventure engine. Play the built-in "Architect's Apprentice" tutorial to learn the ropes, or load your own custom adventures from a `.json` file to create and explore new worlds. For a full guide on creating your own adventures, see `/docs/adventure.md`.

### Advanced Topics

Ready to wield true power? This section covers the tools that separate the administrators from the users.

#### Shell Customization: The `PS1` Variable

You have full control over your command prompt's appearance via the `PS1` environment variable. Use `set` with a string containing special, backslash-escaped characters.

|Sequence|Description|
|---|---|
|`\u`|The current username (e.g., `Guest`).|
|`\h`|The hostname (e.g., `OopisOs`).|
|`\w`|The full path of the current working directory.|
|`\W`|The basename of the current working directory.|
|`\$`|Displays a `#` if the user is `root`, otherwise a `$`.|
|`\\`|A literal backslash character.|

```
Guest@OopisOs:/home/Guest$ set PS1="[\u@\h \W]\\$ "
[Guest@OopisOs Guest]$
```

#### Privilege Escalation: `sudo` and `visudo`

Some tasks require the power of the `root` user. `sudo` is your key to borrowing that power, safely and temporarily.

- **`sudo [command]`** Executes a single command with `root` privileges. You will be prompted for _your own_ password to verify your identity.
- **`visudo`** The only safe way to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file, which controls who can use `sudo`. It locks the file and performs a syntax check on save to prevent you from locking yourself out.

#### File Archival: `zip` and `unzip`

Manage collections of files by bundling them into a single archive.

- **`zip [archive.zip] [path_to_zip]`** Creates a simulated `.zip` archive containing the file or directory.
- **`unzip [archive.zip] [destination_path]`** Extracts the contents of a `.zip` archive into the specified destination.

#### Advanced Command Chaining: `&&`, `||`, and Pipes

The shell supports powerful logical operators for more intelligent command-line workflows.

- **The AND Operator (`&&`)**: The command to the right runs **only** if the command to the left succeeds. `mkdir new_project && cd new_project`
- **The OR Operator (`||`)**: The command to the right runs **only** if the command to its left _fails_. `grep "FATAL" system.log || echo "No fatal errors found."`

# OopisOS v3.3 Architectural Documentation

## 1. Design Philosophy & Core Principles

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the OopisOS project. It is intended for developers who will build upon, extend, or maintain the system. To contribute effectively, it is essential to understand the philosophical underpinnings of the architecture.

OopisOS is more than a simulated operating system; it is an exploration of a fully self-contained, secure, and persistent client-side application paradigm. Its design is governed by five foundational pillars. Every component and decision must be weighed against these principles:

1.  **Radical Self-Reliance:** The system is 100% client-side. It has no dependency on a backend server for its core logic, state, or execution. All functionalityâcommand execution, data storage, etc.âmust be achievable within a modern web browser.
2.  **Architected Persistence:** The system state is not ephemeral. The virtual file system, user credentials, session data, and command history are all persisted locally using the browser's storage APIs. The user is the sole custodian of their data.
3.  **Enforced Modularity:** The system is composed of discrete, specialized components with clear responsibilities. Logic is never intermingled; it is orchestrated.
4.  **Security by Design:** Security is foundational, not a feature. A strict permission model, sandboxed execution for untrusted content, input validation, and secure credential handling enforce the principle of least privilege at every layer.
5.  **Contained & Orchestrated Execution:** All operations flow through controlled channels. The `CommandExecutor` handles processing, while the `OutputManager` controls display. This ensures predictability and prevents unintended side effects.

-----

## 2. System Architecture: A Layered Model

The architecture is layered, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. Each layer communicates through well-defined APIs, creating a stable and predictable system.

### Layer 1: The System Bootstrap & Core Plane

- **`index.html`:** The vessel. Defines the minimal DOM structure and loads all JavaScript modules in the correct, deterministic order.
- **`main.js`:** The ignition sequence. On `window.onload`, it initiates the boot process, caches essential DOM elements, initializes all manager modules, and connects the user to the terminal.
- **`config.js`:** The system's constitution. A centralized source of constantsâpermission modes, UI strings, default paths, etc.
- **`utils.js`:** A library of pure, stateless utility functions for common tasks like DOM creation, string manipulation, and data validation.

### Layer 2: The Command Lifecycle & Execution Engine

- **`lexpar.js`:** Contains the **Lexer** and **Parser**. This is the first stage of the command lifecycle, responsible for converting raw input strings into a structured, executable representation (an abstract syntax tree).
- **`commexec.js`:** The **CommandExecutor** is the heart of the OS. It orchestrates the entire command lifecycle: it receives the parsed command, validates it against the "Command Contract," manages I/O redirection, handles background jobs, and isolates command logic.
- **`scripts/commands/registry.js`:** The **CommandRegistry** is the central manifest where all command modules register their definitions, descriptions, and help texts.
- **`scripts/commands/*.js`:** Each file in this directory represents a self-contained, modular command that adheres to the Command Contract.

### Layer 3: The State & Persistence Core

- **`storage.js`:** The `StorageManager` and `IndexedDBManager` provide a clean, abstracted API for all data persistence, separating the rest of the system from the implementation details of `localStorage` and `IndexedDB`.
- **`fs_manager.js`:** The **FileSystemManager** is the sole authority for the virtual file system. It maintains the in-memory `fsData` object, enforces all permission checks via `hasPermission()`, and handles the serialization of the file system to IndexedDB.
- **`user_manager.js` & `group_manager.js`:** These modules manage the system's social fabric. They handle authentication, user/group creation, and secure credential storage using the Web Crypto API.
- **`session_manager.js`:** Tracks all ephemeral session state: the current user stack (`su`/`logout`), environment variables, and manual session snapshots (`savestate`/`loadstate`).

### Layer 4: The Human-Interface Bridge

- **`terminal_ui.js`:** Manages all direct interaction with the terminal interface, including prompt behavior, tab completion, history navigation, and modal dialogs.
- **`output_manager.js`:** The sole, disciplined channel for all output to the terminal screen. It ensures consistent formatting and handles output suppression for background jobs or redirected streams.

-----

## 3. Core Component Deep Dive

### The Command System: Secure by Process

1.  **Input & Expansion**: User input is received. The `CommandExecutor` expands environment variables (`$VAR`) and aliases.
2.  **Tokenization & Parsing**: The `Lexer` breaks the command string into tokens (words, operators), and the `Parser` assembles these into a structured command pipeline.
3.  **Validation (The Command Contract)**: The `CommandExecutor` validates the parsed command against its registered definition, checking argument counts, path validity, and permissions **before** any logic is run.
4.  **Execution**: The command's `coreLogic` is invoked with a secure, validated context object containing all necessary arguments, flags, and options.

### The File System: A Bastion of State

- **Structure & Persistence**: The file system exists as a single, large JavaScript object (`fsData`). This object is a direct, in-memory representation of the entire directory tree. Upon modification, the `FileSystemManager` serializes this object and persists it to IndexedDB.
- **Security Gateway**: All file system operations, without exception, must pass through the `hasPermission()` gatekeeper within the `FileSystemManager`. This function is the final authority on access control.

### User & Credential Management

- **Secure by Default**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext. The `UserManager` uses the browser's native **Web Crypto API (SHA-256)** to securely hash passwords before they are persisted to `localStorage`.
- **Centralized Authentication**: All login logic resides in the `UserManager`. Secure password input is handled by the `ModalInputManager` to prevent leakage into command history or the screen.

### Full-Screen Applications: Contained Ecosystems

- **`edit` (Editor)**: Demonstrates the separation of state and UI. The `EditorManager` tracks the file content and dirty state, while the `EditorUI` simply renders it. Untrusted user-generated content (e.g., HTML) is rendered in a sandboxed `<iframe>` to prevent XSS attacks.
- **`paint` (Art Studio)**: The `PaintManager` maintains the canvas as an abstract data model, completely decoupled from the `PaintUI` that renders it. Artwork is serialized to a custom JSON format (`.oopic`).
- **`chidi` (Analyzer)**: Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy. It performs a local keyword search on the document corpus to create a focused context before calling the external AI API, optimizing for relevance and efficiency.

-----

## 4. Extending the System: The Command Contract

Adding a new command to OopisOS is a simple and secure process that follows a clear, declarative pattern. As of v3.3, you **do not** need to add a `<script>` tag to `index.html`. The `CommandExecutor` will dynamically load your command script on first use.

### Step 1: Create the Command File

Create a new file in `/scripts/commands/`. The filename must exactly match the command name you wish to use (e.g., `mycommand.js`).

### Step 2: Define the Command Contract

At the top of your file, create a `const` object for your command's definition. This object declares your command's requirements to the `CommandExecutor`.

```javascript
const myCommandDefinition = {
  commandName: "mycommand",

  // Define accepted flags
  flagDefinitions: [
    { name: "force", short: "-f", long: "--force" },
    { name: "outputFile", short: "-o", takesValue: true }
  ],

  // Define argument count rules
  argValidation: {
    min: 1,
    max: 2,
    error: "Usage: mycommand [-f] [-o file] <source> [destination]"
  },

  // Define which arguments are paths and their validation rules
  pathValidation: [
    { argIndex: 0, options: { expectedType: 'file' } },
    { argIndex: 1, options: { allowMissing: true } }
  ],

  // Define required permissions on those paths
  permissionChecks: [
    { pathArgIndex: 0, permissions: ["read"] },
    { pathArgIndex: 1, permissions: ["write"] } // Example check
  ],

  // The core logic function comes next...
  coreLogic: async (context) => { /* ... */ }
};
```

### Step 3: Write the Core Logic

The `coreLogic` function is an `async` function that receives a single `context` object. This object contains everything your command needs, already parsed and validated.

```javascript
coreLogic: async (context) => {
  const { args, flags, currentUser, validatedPaths, options } = context;

  // Your logic here. You can trust that:
  // - `args` contains the correct number of non-flag arguments.
  // - `flags.force` is a boolean, `flags.outputFile` is a string or null.
  // - `validatedPaths[0].node` is a valid file node.
  // - The user has 'read' permission on validatedPaths[0].

  return { success: true, output: "Execution complete." };
}
```

### Step 4: Register the Command

Finally, register your command, its one-line description, and its detailed help text with the `CommandRegistry`.

```javascript
// At the end of your file
const myCommandDescription = "A brief, one-line description of the command.";
const myCommandHelpText = `Usage: mycommand [options]...

The detailed help text for the 'man' command.`;

CommandRegistry.register(
        myCommandDefinition.commandName,
        myCommandDefinition,
        myCommandDescription,
        myCommandHelpText
);

# OopisOS Security Policy

## I. Philosophy

OopisOS treats security as a foundational principle, not an afterthought. Our model is built on three pillars: client-side sandboxing, explicit user permissions, and architected containment.

Most importantly, we believe that **your data is none of our business.** OopisOS is designed to be a private, self-contained world that runs entirely in your browser. We have no servers, we collect no telemetry, and we have no access to your files or credentials.

## II. Core Security Components

### Authentication (`UserManager`)

- **Secure Hashing:** Passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are securely hashed using the browser's native Web Crypto API with the SHA-256 algorithm before being stored locally.
- **Audited Flows:** Login and user-switching (`su`) flows are handled through a single, audited authentication manager to prevent timing attacks, bypasses, or credential leakage.

### Authorization (`FileSystemManager`)

- **Centralized Gatekeeping:** All file system access is gated by the `FileSystemManager.hasPermission()` function. There are no back doors.
- **Granular Permissions:** This function rigorously checks file ownership (`owner`, `group`) against the file's octal mode (`rwx`) and the current user's identity for every operation.
- **Superuser Exception:** The `root` user is an explicit, carefully managed exception that bypasses standard permission checks, as is standard in Unix-like systems.

### Privilege Escalation (`SudoManager`)

- **Controlled Elevation:** The `sudo` command allows for temporary, controlled privilege escalation. Access is governed by the `/etc/sudoers` file, which is only editable by `root` via the `visudo` command.
- **Scoped Privileges:** Escalated privileges are granted for only a single command and are immediately revoked within a `try...finally` block to ensure they do not persist longer than necessary.

## III. Data Privacy & Persistence

OopisOS is designed to be completely private.

- **Local Storage:** All your dataâthe file system, user accounts, and session informationâis stored exclusively in your browser's `localStorage` and `IndexedDB`. It never leaves your computer.
- **User Control:** You have full control over your data. You can export it with the `backup` command or permanently erase it with the `reset` command.

## IV. Best Practices for Users

- **Guard the Root Password:** Do not share your `root` password. It provides unrestricted access to the entire virtual file system.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Operate as a standard user (`Guest`) for daily tasks. Only use `su` or `sudo` when administrative privileges are required.
- **Audit Permissions:** Regularly review file permissions using `ls -l` to ensure they are set as you expect.
- **Be Wary of Unknown Scripts:** Be cautious when running scripts (`run` command) or viewing files from untrusted sources, just as you would on any other OS.

## V. Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of OopisOS is our top priority. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly.

Please email a detailed description of the issue to **oopismcgoopis@gmail.com**. We are committed to working with you to understand and resolve the issue promptly.

# OopisOS v3.3 Tutorials

Welcome to the OopisOS tutorials. While the Command Reference explains what each command does, this guide will show you how to combine them to accomplish larger tasks. These walkthroughs are designed to teach you the core workflows of the operating system.

### Your First Shell Script

**Objective:** To create and run a simple, executable script that can accept arguments from the command line.

This tutorial will teach you how to use the `edit` program, change file permissions with `chmod`, and execute your new script with `run`.

**Step 1: Create the Script File**
First, let's create a file for our script using the text editor.
```bash
edit welcome.sh
```

**Step 2: Write the Script's Logic**
The `edit` application will open. Type the following line into the editor:

```bash
echo "Welcome to OopisOS, $1!"
```

The `$1` is a special variable that represents the *first argument* you pass to the script. After typing the line, save and exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+S`.

**Step 3: Make the Script Executable**
By default, new files are not executable. Use `chmod` to add execute permissions. A mode of `700` is perfect for a personal script, as it gives you full control.

```bash
chmod 700 welcome.sh
```

Run `ls -l welcome.sh` to see the permissions change from `-rw-r--r--` to `-rwx------`.

**Step 4: Run the Script**
Finally, execute your script using the `run` command, and give it an argument to see the `$1` variable in action.

```bash
run ./welcome.sh "Developer"
```

The system will output: `Welcome to OopisOS, Developer!` You have successfully created and run your first shell script.

### The Gauntlet: `diag.sh`

Our quality assurance department in a script. It's a relentless stress test that runs a barrage of commands to ensure all systems are operational. To run it, you must first upload it to your home directory.

1.  **Upload the Script:** Use the `upload` command. When the file dialog opens, select the `diag.sh` file located in the `/extras/` directory of the OopisOS source code. This will upload it to your current directory (`/home/Guest`).
    ```
    Guest@OopisOs:/home/Guest> upload
    ```
    <br />
2.  **Run the Gauntlet:** Once uploaded, make the script executable and run it.
    ```
    Guest@OopisOs:/home/Guest> chmod 755 diag.sh
    Guest@OopisOs:/home/Guest> run ./diag.sh
    ```

### Setting Up a Shared Project

**Objective:** To demonstrate the full security model by creating a new group, adding users to it, and creating a shared directory that only group members can access.

**Step 1: Assume Administrative Role with `sudo`**
To manage users and groups, you need administrative privileges. Use the `sudo` command to run these commands. You will be prompted for the `root` user's password (`mcgoopis`).

```bash
sudo useradd devone
# (set password for devone)
sudo useradd devtwo
# (set password for devtwo)
sudo groupadd project_phoenix
```

**Step 2: Add Users to the Group**
Now, add both new users to the `project_phoenix` group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG project_phoenix devone
sudo usermod -aG project_phoenix devtwo
```

**Step 3: Create and Secure the Project Directory**
Log in as one of the developers to create the shared directory.

```bash
login devone
# (enter devone's password)
mkdir /home/project_phoenix
```

By default, this directory is owned by `devone`. We need to change its group and permissions. Since `devone` owns the directory, they don't need `sudo` for these commands.

```bash
chgrp project_phoenix /home/project_phoenix
chmod 770 /home/project_phoenix
```

The mode `770` (`rwxrwx---`) gives the owner (`devone`) and the group (`project_phoenix`) full access, while denying access to anyone else.

**Step 4: Test the Permissions**
As `devone`, you can create a file. Now, log out and log in as `devtwo`, who should also be able to create a file, proving the group permissions work.

```bash
touch /home/project_phoenix/devone_file.txt
logout
login devtwo
# (enter devtwo's password)
touch /home/project_phoenix/devtwo_file.txt
```

You have successfully created a secure, collaborative workspace.

-----

### Exploring Your System with AI

**Objective:** To showcase how the integrated AI tools (`chidi` and `gemini`) can be used to analyze and interact with your file system.

**Step 1: Populate Your Home Directory**
First, ensure you are logged in as `Guest` and run the `inflate.sh` script to create a variety of example files.

```bash
run /extras/inflate.sh
```

**Step 2: Analyze Documents with `chidi`**
Now that you have some Markdown files, use the AI Librarian to analyze them.

```bash
chidi /home/Guest/docs
```

This opens a new interface listing all `.md` files in that directory. You can click "Summarize" to get an AI-generated summary or "Ask" to query the entire set of documents.

**Step 3: Use `gemini` for System Queries**
The `gemini` command can use other OS tools to answer questions about the system.

```bash
gemini "list all the oopic files in the home directory"
```

The AI will understand the request, run `find /home -name "*.oopic"`, and present the results in a user-friendly format.

### **El CÃ³digo del Taco: A Layered Architectural Model**

The "El CÃ³digo del Taco" is a formal architectural model for developing complex, stateful, and secure client-side applications with a focus on radical self-relianceâthe ability to operate entirely within the browser without server-side dependencies.

The model posits that any robust application can be deconstructed into a series of well-defined, concentric layers, analogous to the ingredients of a taco. Each layer has a distinct purpose and responsibility, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

#### The Seven Layers

1.  **The Protein (La ProteÃ­na) â The Core Business Logic Layer**: The soul of the application. For OopisOS, this is the `CommandExecutor` and the core state managers.
2.  **The Lettuce & Cabbage (La Lechuga y el Repollo) â The Presentation Layer**: The UI/UX. In OopisOS, this is the `terminal_ui.js` and `output_manager.js`.
3.  **The Cheese (El Queso) â The Feature & Enhancement Layer**: Value-add features that aren't core to the main function. Examples include the `gemini` and `chidi` AI tools.
4.  **The Salsa & Crema (La Salsa y la Crema) â The API & Data Layer**: The unifying agent that ties everything together, like the `StorageManager`.
5.  **The Onions & Cilantro (La Cebolla y el Cilantro) â The Utility & Environment Layer**: Small, potent, non-negotiable accents like `utils.js` and `config.js`.
6.  **The JalapeÃ±o (El JalapeÃ±o) â The Security & Validation Layer**: Controlled heat. This represents security layers, validation logic, and error handling.
7.  **The Fold (El Doblez) â The Build & Deployment Architecture**: Bringing all components together. In OopisOS, this is `index.html` and the script loading order.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>What is OopisOS?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>OopisOS is a sophisticated OS simulation that runs entirely in your web browser. It's a self-contained, persistent world with a command-line interface, a multi-user file system, and a suite of applications. It's designed to be a private, educational, and fun environment to explore command-line concepts without any installation.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is my data safe? Where is it stored?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Your data is completely private and is never sent to any server. The entire file system, user accounts, and session data are stored exclusively in your browser's <code>localStorage</code> and <code>IndexedDB</code>. The OopisOS developers have no access to it. Your world is your own.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I lose my data? How do I back it up?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Yes. Because all data is stored in your browser, clearing your browser's site data for this page will permanently erase your OopisOS instance.</p>
    <p><br />To prevent data loss, you can create a complete backup using the <code>backup</code> command. This will package your entire OS state into a single <code>.json</code> file and prompt you to download it to your actual computer. You can restore from this file at any time using the <code>restore</code> command.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to install anything?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>No. OopisOS is 100% client-side and "radically self-reliant." It runs entirely in your browser with no need for installations, plugins, or server-side dependencies.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I get administrative (root) privileges?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You can execute a single command with root privileges using <code>sudo [command]</code>. This will prompt you for your user's password. For a persistent root session, you can use <code>su root</code> and enter the root password. For daily tasks, it's recommended to operate as a standard user and only elevate your privileges when necessary, following the Principle of Least Privilege.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I add new commands to the system?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>As a developer, you can extend the OS by adding new commands. This involves creating a new JavaScript file in the <code>/scripts/commands/</code> directory. Inside this file, you must define a "Command Contract" object that specifies the command's name, flags, arguments, and core logic. Finally, you register the command with the <code>CommandRegistry</code>. The system will then load your new command on-demand the first time it's called.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is "El CÃ³digo del Taco"?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>"El CÃ³digo del Taco" is a formal architectural model used to design OopisOS. While the name is a bit of fun, it represents a serious design philosophy. It structures the application into seven distinct, taco-themed layersâfrom core logic (<em>La ProteÃ­na</em>) to the build process (<em>El Doblez</em>). This ensures a high degree of modularity, security, and maintainability.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between the `chidi` and `gemini` commands?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Both are AI-powered tools, but they have different purposes:</p><br />
    <ul>
      <li><code>gemini</code> is a general-purpose, conversational AI assistant. It can use other OopisOS commands as tools to answer questions about the system (e.g., "gemini list all text files in my home directory").</li>
      <br /><li><code>chidi</code> is a specialized "AI Librarian" application. You point it at a directory of Markdown files, and it provides a dedicated interface for reading, summarizing, and asking questions across that specific set of documents. It's designed for deep work on a knowledge base.</li>

# OopisOS and Chidi: A Sandbox, Tool-Using AI Agent With Memory

#### 1\. Executive Summary

The `chidi` command launches the Chidi.md application, a cornerstone of the OopisOS ecosystem that transforms the system from a mere collection of files into a cohesive, analyzable knowledge base. It is a purpose-built platform for deep work on a specific corpus of documents, integrating a clean reading environment with a powerful, multi-faceted AI toolkit.

Unlike the generalist `gemini` command, `chidi` provides a focused, application-level experience. Its ability to recursively gather documents, present them in a dedicated modal interface, and run targeted AI analysis elevates it beyond a simple command into a flagship application for the entire OS.

#### **2. Core Functionality & User Experience**

The user's journey with `chidi` is designed for focus and power:

1.  **Invocation:** The user invokes `chidi` with a path to a single `.md` file or, more powerfully, to a directory (e.g., `chidi /docs/api`).
2.  **Recursive File Discovery:** The command's logic recursively traverses the specified path, gathering all `.md` files while respecting the current user's read and execute permissions. This builds the "corpus" for the application session.
3.  **Modal Application Launch:** The `ChidiApp` launches in a full-screen modal view, deliberately removing the user from the terminal to allow for focused reading and analysis.
4.  **The Chidi.md Interface:**
    * **Navigation:** Users can navigate between multiple files using `PREV`/`NEXT` buttons or a dropdown file selector.
    * **Clean Reading:** The main pane presents a beautifully rendered HTML view of the selected Markdown file via `marked.js`.
    * **AI Toolkit:** A dedicated control panel offers primary AI-driven actions:
        * **Summarize:** Generates a concise summary of the currently viewed document.
        * **Study:** Generates a list of potential study questions or key topics.
        * **Ask:** The most powerful feature. It allows the user to ask a natural language question across the *entire corpus* of loaded documents.
    * **Session & Log Management:**
        * **Save Session:** Users can save the entire state of their analysisâthe original document plus all generated AI responsesâto a new, self-contained HTML file in the virtual file system.
        * **Verbose Log:** A toggle allows power users to view the AI's step-by-step reasoning, including which files it selected for context.
5.  **Exit:** A clear "Exit" button or the `Esc` key closes the application, returning the user to their fully preserved terminal session.

#### **3. Technical & Architectural Deep-Dive**

The implementation of `chidi` adheres to our established modular design principles.

* **Separation of Concerns:** A clear distinction exists between the command (`chidi.js`) and the application (`chidi_app.js`), which handles all UI, state, and API interaction.
* **API Key Management:** The application correctly identifies its dependency on the Gemini API key and gracefully prompts the user for it if not found, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.
* **Intelligent Contextual Scoping (RAG):** The "Ask" feature employs a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy. Instead of naively sending all content to the API, it first performs a local keyword search to identify the most relevant documents. It then constructs a highly-focused prompt containing only the content of these top-scoring files. This approach optimizes for relevance, reduces API costs, and dramatically improves the quality and accuracy of the generated answer.

#### **4. Synergy with the OopisOS Ecosystem**

The `chidi` command is deeply integrated with the OopisOS toolchain.

* **Content Creation:** It is the perfect companion to the `edit` command. Users can create and organize documentation, then immediately use `chidi` to analyze that work.
* **File Management:** It works in concert with `find`, `mkdir`, and `cp`, which are essential tools for organizing the document collections that `chidi` will consume.
* **Demonstration & Onboarding:** The `inflate.sh` script creates a perfect, ready-made environment for users to immediately test the full power of `chidi` on the sample `/docs` directory.
* **Complement to `gemini`:** It provides a clear functional distinction: `gemini` is a generalist conversational partner that plans and executes shell commands to answer questions, while `chidi` is a specialist application for deep, context-aware analysis of a pre-defined set of documents.

#### **5. Strengths & Opportunities**

**Strengths:**

* **Purpose-Built UI:** The modal interface provides a focused "application" experience.
* **Multi-File Corpus:** The ability to analyze an entire directory of documents at once is its killer feature.
* **Session Persistence:** The ability to save a complete analysis session (document + AI responses) to a new file transforms `chidi` from a simple reader into a genuine research and note-taking tool.
* **Efficient AI Implementation:** The RAG strategy for the "Ask" feature is technically sophisticated and highly effective.
* **Seamless Integration:** It feels like a natural and powerful extension of the core OS features.

**Opportunities for Future Enhancement:**

* **Expanded File Type Support:** While the renderer can display `.txt` files, the command's file discovery logic is currently limited to `.md`. Expanding this discovery to include `.txt` or even extracting comments from code files (`.js`, `.sh`) remains a clear opportunity for growth.
* **Integration with `find`:** A future version could allow for more complex corpus creation, such as `find / -name "*-log.md" -mtime -7 | chidi`, piping a list of files directly into the application.

#### **6. Conclusion**

The `chidi` command and its associated application are an unqualified success. It is a robust, well-designed feature that adds immense value and a new dimension of utility to OopisOS. It elevates the platform from a simple shell simulation to a genuine productivity and learning environment. The implementation is sound, the user experience is polished, and its potential for future expansion is significant.

# The OopisOS Text Adventure Engine

Welcome, Architect. This document is your guide to the OopisOS Text Adventure Engine, a powerful tool for creating and playing interactive fiction directly within the operating system. Whether you want to play the built-in game or build your own world from scratch, this manual will show you how.

### 1. How to Play

Getting started is simple. Just type `adventure` into the terminal to launch the default story, "The Architect's Apprentice."

```
> adventure
```

### 2. The Anatomy of an Adventure

Every adventure is a world defined by a single `.json` file. This file contains all the rooms, items, characters, and logic that make up the game. The engine is designed to be data-driven, meaning you don't need to write any code to create a complex adventure; you just need to describe your world in the JSON format.

Let's break down the main components using examples from the default adventure.

#### **Rooms**

Rooms are the fundamental building blocks of your world. Each room is an object with a unique ID.

```
"test_chamber": {
    "name": "Test Chamber",
    "description": "You are in a room that feels... unfinished...",
    "exits": { "north": "server_closet" },
    "onListen": "You hear a low, persistent hum.",
    "points": 5
}
```

- `name`: The title of the room, displayed in the status bar.

- `description`: The main text shown to the player when they enter or `look`.

- `exits`: An object mapping directions (or custom exit names) to the ID of another room.

- `isDark`: (boolean) If `true`, the room's description will be hidden unless the player has a lit `isLightSource` item.

- `onListen` / `onSmell` / `onTouch`: Custom text that is displayed when the player uses a sensory verb (`listen`, `smell`, `touch`) in the room without a specific target.

- `points`: The number of points awarded to the player for visiting the room for the first time.


#### **Items**

Items are the objects that populate your world. They can be taken, used, and interacted with in various ways.

```
"key": {
    "id": "key",
    "name": "brass key",
    "noun": "key",
    "adjectives": ["brass", "small"],
    "description": "A small, plain brass key.",
    "location": "test_chamber",
    "canTake": true,
    "unlocks": "chest",
    "points": 10
}
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for the item.

- `name`: The full name of the item (e.g., "brass key").

- `noun`: The primary noun for the parser (e.g., "key").

- `adjectives`: An array of adjectives to help the parser disambiguate (e.g., `take brass key` vs. `take iron key`).

- `description`: The text shown when the player `look`s at the item.

- `location`: The ID of the room, NPC, or container item where the item starts. Can also be `"player"` for starting inventory.

- `canTake`: (boolean) Determines if the player can pick up the item.

- `unlocks`: The `id` of an item this item can unlock. Used with the `unlock [item] with [key]` command.

- `points`: Score awarded for taking the item for the first time.


#### **Stateful & Interactive Items**

Items can be much more than static objects. They can have states, contain other items, and react to player actions.

**Containers:** To make an item a container, add these properties:

- `isContainer`: `true`

- `isOpenable`: `true`

- `isOpen`: `false` (initial state)

- `isLocked`: `true` (optional)

- `contains`: An array of item IDs that are inside.


**State-Dependent Descriptions:** An item's description can change based on its `state` property. This is perfect for things that can be turned on or off.

```
"terminal": {
    "id": "terminal",
    "name": "computer terminal",
    "location": "test_chamber",
    "state": "off",
    "descriptions": {
        "off": "A computer terminal with a blank, dark screen.",
        "on": "The terminal screen glows with a soft green light..."
    }
}
```

**Complex Interactions (`onPush`, `onUse`):** You can define what happens when a player `push`es, `pull`s, or `turn`s an item. This can change the item's own state and even affect other items in the world.

```
"power_box": {
    "id": "power_box",
    "state": "off",
    "onPush": {
        "newState": "on",
        "message": "You push the heavy lever. It clunks into the 'ON' position.",
        "effects": [
            { "targetId": "terminal", "newState": "on" }
        ]
    }
}
```

The `use [item] on [target]` command allows for even more specific puzzles.

```
"terminal": {
    // ...
    "onUse": {
        "page": {
            "conditions": [
                { "itemId": "terminal", "requiredState": "on" }
            ],
            "failureMessage": "You touch the page to the dark screen, but nothing happens.",
            "destroyItem": true
        }
    }
}
```

- `onUse`: An object where keys are the `id` of the item being used.

- `conditions`: An array of requirements that must be met for the action to succeed.

- `failureMessage`: The message shown if conditions are not met.

- `destroyItem`: If `true`, the item used (e.g., the page) is removed from the player's inventory.


#### **NPCs (Non-Player Characters)**

You can add characters to your world for the player to interact with.

```
"architect": {
    "id": "architect",
    "name": "The Architect",
    "noun": "architect",
    "location": "test_chamber",
    "dialogue": {
        "default": "'Welcome, apprentice,' the holographic figure says.",
        "terminal": "'The terminal is the key to compiling the environment...'"
    },
    "onShow": {
        "page": "The Architect's form stabilizes... 'Excellent! Now, use the page...'",
        "default": "The Architect glances at the item but doesn't react."
    }
}
```

- `dialogue`: An object mapping keywords to responses. The player triggers these with `ask [npc] about [keyword]`. A `default` response is used for `talk to [npc]` or if no keyword matches.

- `onShow`: Defines how an NPC reacts when the player uses `show [item] to [npc]`.


#### **Daemons (Timed Events)**

Daemons are background processes that can trigger events based on game turns. This is useful for providing hints or creating time-sensitive events.

```
"hint_daemon": {
    "active": true,
    "repeatable": true,
    "trigger": {
        "type": "every_x_turns",
        "value": 10
    },
    "action": {
        "type": "message",
        "text": "The Architect looks at you thoughtfully..."
    }
}
```

- `trigger.type`: Can be `every_x_turns` or `on_turn` (for a specific move number).

- `action.type`: Currently supports `message`, which displays text to the player.


#### **Win Conditions**

You define how the game is won in the root of the JSON file.

```
"winCondition": {
    "type": "itemUsedOn",
    "itemId": "page",
    "targetId": "terminal"
},
"winMessage": "You have won!"
```

- `type`: Can be `itemInRoom` (player must drop a specific item in a specific room), `playerHasItem` (player must simply acquire an item), or `itemUsedOn` (player must use one item on another).


### 3. Creating Your First Adventure

1. **Create a JSON File:** Create a new file named `my_adventure.json` using `touch` or `edit`.

2. **Define the World:** Start with the basic structure: a title, starting room, and a win condition.

3. **Build the Rooms:** Create at least two room objects inside the `rooms` section. Give them names, descriptions, and link them with `exits`.

4. **Add Items:** Populate your rooms with items. Create a key and a locked object, or a simple item the player needs to find.

5. **Upload the File:** Use the `upload` command to add your `.json` file to the virtual file system.

6. **Play!** Launch your adventure with `adventure my_adventure.json`.

# Architect's Apprentice - Beta Test Walkthrough

**Objective:** This document provides a step-by-step guide to completing the default text adventure, "The Architect's Apprentice." Its purpose is to allow beta testers to verify the game's core logic, puzzle progression, and feature implementation.

### Step 1: Getting Started

You begin in the `Test Chamber`. The first thing you should do is get your bearings and understand your objective.

1. **Talk to the Architect** to learn about your primary goal.

    ```
    > talk to architect
    ```

2. **Examine the room** to identify key objects.

    ```
    > look
    ```

    You will see a desk, a chest, a terminal, and the Architect.


### Step 2: Finding the Key

The chest is locked, so you'll need to find a key.

1. **Look at the desk** more closely.

    ```
    > look at desk
    ```

2. You'll see a key on the desk. **Take it**.

    ```
    > take key
    ```

    _Pronoun Test:_ The Architect may prompt you to "take it." You can test the pronoun resolution by typing: `> take it`


### Step 3: Unlocking the Chest & Finding the Page

Now you can open the chest to find the main quest item.

1. **Unlock the chest** using the key you just found.

    ```
    > unlock chest with key
    ```

2. **Open the chest**.

    ```
    > open chest
    ```

3. **Take the manual page** from inside the chest.

    ```
    > take page
    ```

4. **Read the page** to understand its purpose. It mentions needing to power up the terminal.

    ```
    > read page
    ```


### Step 4: Powering the Terminal

The terminal is off. You need to find the power source.

1. **Ask the Architect about the terminal** for a hint.

    ```
    > ask architect about terminal
    ```

2. He'll mention it's without power. The only other exit is north. **Go north** into the server closet.

    ```
    > go north
    ```

3. The closet is dark. You'll need a light source. **Take the lantern**.

    ```
    > take lantern
    ```

4. **Light the lantern**.

    ```
    > light lantern
    ```

5. With the room now lit, **look around** to find the power box.

    ```
    > look
    ```

6. **Push the lever** on the power box to turn it on.

    ```
    > push lever
    ```

    You will receive a message that the terminal in the other room is now powered on.


### Step 5: Compiling the Room (Winning the Game)

You have the manual page and the terminal is powered on. It's time to finish the test.

1. **Go south** to return to the main chamber.

    ```
    > go south
    ```

2. **Look at the terminal** to confirm it is now on.

    ```
    > look at terminal
    ```

3. **Use the manual page on the terminal** to complete the objective and win the game.

    ```
    > use page on terminal
    ```


If you've followed these steps, the game should conclude with the win message. Please report any deviations, errors, or unexpected behavior. Thank you for your help in testing!

### OopisOS and Paint: The Digital Canvas

#### 1. Executive Summary

The `paint` command launches the OopisOS character-based art studio, a surprisingly robust application for creating ASCII and ANSI art. It serves as a primary creative outlet within the OS, embodying the system's philosophy of providing powerful, self-contained tools that are both functional and fun. `paint` transforms the terminal from a purely textual interface into a visual canvas, offering users a unique way to express themselves and generate assets for other parts of the OopisOS ecosystem, such as the `adventure` game engine.

#### 2. Core Functionality & User Experience

The paint application provides a focused, full-screen, modal experience for digital art creation.

1. **Invocation:** The user launches the editor with `paint [filename.oopic]`. If the file exists, it's loaded onto the canvas; otherwise, a new canvas is created, ready to be saved to that filename.

2. **The Paint Interface:** The UI is composed of three main areas:

    - **Toolbar:** A comprehensive set of tools for creation, including a pencil, eraser, shape tools (line, rectangle, ellipse), character selector, color palette, brush size controls, zoom, and a grid toggle.

    - **Canvas:** A fixed-size (80x24) grid where users draw by placing characters with specific foreground colors.

    - **Status Bar:** Provides real-time feedback on the current tool, character, color, brush size, cursor coordinates, and zoom level.

3. **Core Tools & Features:**

    - **Drawing Tools:** Users can select between a freehand `pencil`, an `eraser` to clear cells, and `shape` tools for drawing lines, rectangles, and ellipses.

    - **Character & Color:** Any printable ASCII character can be selected for drawing. A default palette of colors is available, with an option to select any custom hex color.

    - **Brush Size:** The pencil and eraser tools can be adjusted from a 1x1 to a 5x5 brush size for broader strokes.

    - **Undo/Redo:** A multi-level undo/redo stack (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`) allows for non-destructive editing.

4. **Saving and File Format:** Artwork is saved to a custom `.oopic` file format. This is a JSON-based format that stores the canvas dimensions and a 2D array representing each cell's character and color, making it human-readable and easy to parse.

5. **Keyboard-Driven Workflow:** The application is designed for power users, with keyboard shortcuts for nearly every action, including tool selection (`P`, `E`), color selection (`1-6`), and saving/exiting (`Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+O`).


#### 3. Technical & Architectural Deep-Dive

The paint application is a model of the OopisOS modular design philosophy.

- **Separation of Concerns:** The application logic is neatly divided between `PaintManager` and `PaintUI`.

    - `PaintManager`: The "brain" that manages the application state, including the canvas data model (a 2D array of cell objects), tool selection, color, brush size, and the undo/redo stacks. It contains all the core drawing logic.

    - `PaintUI`: The "hands" responsible for all DOM manipulation. It builds the layout, renders the canvas data into a grid of styled `<span>` elements, and forwards user input events to the `PaintManager`.

- **Canvas Rendering:** The canvas is not a single `<canvas>` element but a CSS grid of individual `<span>` elements. This allows each character cell to be styled independently with its own color, making "ANSI" style art possible, and simplifies the logic for updating specific cells without redrawing the entire canvas.

- **State Management:** The `undoStack` is a core component. Before a drawing action begins, the current state of the entire canvas is pushed onto the stack. This allows for simple and reliable undo/redo functionality.

- **File Format (`.oopic`):** The choice of a JSON-based file format over a binary one is deliberate. It aligns with the transparent, text-based nature of OopisOS and allows users to inspect or even manually edit their artwork using standard tools like `cat` and `edit`.


#### 4. Synergy with the OopisOS Ecosystem

The `paint` application is not an isolated feature but a deeply integrated part of the creative toolchain.

- **Asset Creation:** Its primary purpose is to allow users to create visual assets. These can be simple icons, title screens for scripts, or detailed maps and character portraits for custom games running on the `adventure` engine.

- **Standard File Operations:** Art files (`.oopic`) are treated like any other file in the system. They can be listed with `ls`, moved with `mv`, copied with `cp`, and organized into directories with `mkdir`, fully integrating them into the user's workflow.

- **Scripting and Automation:** A user could write a script using `run` that displays different `.oopic` files using the `cat` command (which would show the raw JSON) to create simple, frame-based animations or storyboards.


#### 5. Strengths & Opportunities

**Strengths:**

- **Creative Freedom:** Provides a unique and powerful creative outlet that perfectly matches the retro-futuristic aesthetic of OopisOS.

- **Intuitive UI:** Despite its complexity, the toolbar and keyboard shortcuts make the application easy to learn and efficient to use.

- **Robust Feature Set:** The inclusion of shape tools, custom colors, brush sizes, and undo/redo elevates it far beyond a simple pixel editor.

- **Ecosystem Integration:** Its role as an asset creator for other applications, especially `adventure`, gives it a clear and compelling purpose within the OS.


**Opportunities for Future Enhancement:**

- **Advanced Tools:** A "fill bucket" tool for coloring large areas, and a "select" tool for moving or copying sections of the canvas, are logical next steps.

- **Animation Support:** Evolving the `.oopic` format to support multiple frames could turn the application into a powerful tool for creating animated sprites and cutscenes.

- **Character Sets:** Allowing users to select from different character sets (e.g., box-drawing characters, block elements) could enable more sophisticated artwork.


#### 6. Conclusion

The `paint` application is a testament to the creative potential of OopisOS. It is a feature-rich, well-architected, and deeply enjoyable tool that provides a tangible benefit to users. By providing a canvas for artistic expression, `paint` solidifies the identity of OopisOS not just as a simulated operating system, but as a complete, self-contained sandbox for creation.

### OopisOS and Edit: The Context-Aware Creative Suite

#### 1. Executive Summary

The `edit` command is the cornerstone of content creation within OopisOS. It is not merely a text editor but a context-aware creative suite that intelligently adapts its interface and features to the type of file being manipulated. By providing a rich, full-screen modal application for text, Markdown, and HTML, `edit` bridges the gap between the raw power of the command line and the nuanced requirements of document authoring and script writing. It is the primary tool for generating the very content that gives the OopisOS ecosystem its depth and purpose.

#### 2. Core Functionality & User Experience

The `edit` command launches a sophisticated modal application designed for a seamless and productive workflow. Its intelligence lies in its ability to understand what it's editing.

1. **Invocation:** A user starts the editor by typing `edit [filename]`. If the file exists, it is loaded; if not, a blank slate is presented, ready to be saved to that new file path.

2. **Context-Aware Modes:** The editor inspects the file's extension and automatically configures itself:

    - **`.txt`, `.sh`, `.js`, etc. (Text Mode):** Provides a clean, straightforward text editing experience focused on code and plain text.

    - **`.md` (Markdown Mode):** Activates a powerful split-screen view with the raw text on one side and a live, rendered HTML preview on the other. A formatting toolbar appears, offering one-click access to common Markdown syntax like bold, italics, lists, and links.

    - **`.html` (HTML Mode):** Also uses the split-screen view, rendering the user's HTML code in a sandboxed `<iframe>` for a live, safe preview.

3. **Productivity-Focused UI:**

    - **View Toggling (`Ctrl+P`):** Users can cycle between the split-screen view, an editor-only view for focused writing, and a preview-only view for clean reading.

    - **Status Bar:** A persistent status bar provides crucial information at a glance, including the current filename, dirty status (unsaved changes), line/word/character counts, and the precise cursor position.

    - **Keyboard-First Design:** The editor is built for efficiency, with essential keyboard shortcuts for saving (`Ctrl+S`), exiting (`Ctrl+O`), undo/redo (`Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y`), and text formatting.

#### 3. Technical & Architectural Deep-Dive

The `edit` command's implementation is a prime example of the OopisOS philosophy of enforced modularity. The application is cleanly separated into two main components: `EditorManager` and `EditorUI`.

- **`EditorManager` (The Brain):** This module is the single source of truth for the editor's state. It knows nothing about the DOM. Its sole responsibilities are to track the `currentFilePath`, the `originalContent` (to determine if the file is `isDirty`), the `currentFileMode` (text, markdown, or html), and to manage the `undoStack` and `redoStack`. All core logic for text manipulation and state changes resides here.

- **`EditorUI` (The Hands):** This module is responsible for all DOM manipulation. It builds the editor's layout, renders the text area and preview pane, updates the status bar, and listens for user input events. It takes its instructions from the `EditorManager` but has no knowledge of the underlying file system or state logic.

- **Secure Rendering:** To prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, user-generated content is handled safely. Markdown is rendered using the `marked.js` library with its sanitization feature enabled. Untrusted HTML content is rendered inside a sandboxed `<iframe>`, which isolates it from the main application's DOM and scripts.


This strict separation makes the editor robust, secure, and easy to maintain. A change to the UI in `EditorUI` cannot accidentally break the state logic in `EditorManager`.

#### 4. Synergy with the OopisOS Ecosystem

The `edit` command is the creative engine that fuels the rest of the OS. It is not an isolated tool but a central hub of activity.

- **Scripting (`run`):** It is the primary tool for writing the `.sh` scripts that are executed by the `run` command, enabling users to automate tasks and create complex programs.

- **AI Analysis (`chidi`, `gemini`):** It is used to author the `.md` documents that the `chidi` AI Librarian analyzes. It's also perfect for crafting complex, multi-line prompts to be saved in a file and then piped to the `gemini` command using `cat`.

- **System Configuration:** As a text editor, it is the natural tool for modifying system configuration files, such as `/etc/oopis.conf` to change the terminal prompt or `/etc/sudoers` (via the safe `visudo` command) to manage permissions.

- **Game Development (`adventure`):** Users can write the entire narrative, room descriptions, and item interactions for a custom text adventure in a `.json` file using `edit`, then immediately playtest it with the `adventure` command.

#### 5. Strengths & Opportunities

**Strengths:**

- **Context-Awareness:** Automatically switching modes based on file extension is its most powerful and user-friendly feature.

- **Live Preview:** The split-screen preview for Markdown and HTML is an essential feature for modern development and writing workflows.

- **Robustness:** The separation of state (`EditorManager`) and UI (`EditorUI`) makes the application stable and less prone to bugs.

- **Security:** The use of sanitization and sandboxed iframes for rendering user content demonstrates a commitment to security by design.

**Opportunities for Future Enhancement:**

- **Syntax Highlighting:** Implementing syntax highlighting for common file types (`.js`, `.css`, `.sh`) would significantly improve the code editing experience.

- **Search and Replace:** A find/replace feature is a standard expectation for text editors and would be a valuable addition.

- **Theming:** Allowing users to select different color schemes for the editor would enhance personalization.

#### 6. Conclusion

The `edit` command is the heart of productivity in OopisOS. It successfully elevates a simple command-line utility into a rich, graphical application without sacrificing the keyboard-driven efficiency that power users expect. By intelligently adapting to the user's needs and providing a secure, feature-rich environment for content creation, `edit` perfectly embodies the OopisOS philosophy of building powerful, self-reliant, and user-centric tools.
