# OopisOS v3.6 Tutorials

Welcome, Architect. This guide is your first step into the larger world of OopisOS. While the Command Reference is your dictionary, these tutorials are your Rosetta Stone, teaching you not just what commands do, but how to combine them into powerful, meaningful workflows.

Our goal is to transition control of the system to you, providing the tools and knowledge needed to explore with confidence and security. Let's begin.

## 1. The Basics: Creating and Automating

### Tutorial 1.1: Your First Shell Script

**Objective:** To create and run a simple, executable script that can accept arguments from the command line. This tutorial covers `edit`, `chmod`, and `run`.

- Step 1: Create the Script File

  First, let's create a file for our script using the text editor.

  Bash

    ```
    edit welcome.sh
    ```

- Step 2: Write the Script's Logic

  The edit application will open. Type the following line into the editor:

  Bash

    ```
    echo "Welcome to OopisOS, $1!"
    ```

  The `$1` is a special variable that represents the _first argument_ you pass to the script. After typing the line, save and exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+S`.

- Step 3: Make the Script Executable

  By default, new files are not executable. Use chmod to add execute permissions. A mode of 700 is perfect for a personal script, as it gives you full control.

  Bash

    ```
    chmod 700 welcome.sh
    ```

  Run `ls -l welcome.sh` to see the permissions change from `-rw-r--r--` to `-rwx------`.

- Step 4: Run the Script

  Finally, execute your script using the run command, and give it an argument to see the $1 variable in action.

  Bash

    ```
    run ./welcome.sh "Developer"
    ```

  The system will output: `Welcome to OopisOS, Developer!` You have successfully created and run your first shell script.

## 2. The Security Model in Practice

### Tutorial 2.1: Setting Up a Shared Project

**Objective:** To demonstrate the full security model by creating a new group, adding a user, and creating a shared directory that only group members can access.

- Step 1: Assume Administrative Role

  To manage users and groups, you need root privileges. If you are not root, use su or login. For this tutorial, we will log in as root using the default password, mcgoopis.

  Bash

    ```
    login root mcgoopis
    ```

- Step 2: Create a User and Group

  Now, create a new user and a group for your project.

  Bash

    ```
    useradd devone
    # (set a password for devone when prompted)
    groupadd project_phoenix
    ```

- Step 3: Add the User to the Group

  Use the usermod command with the -aG flag to append the user to the new group.

  Bash

    ```
    usermod -aG project_phoenix devone
    ```

  You can verify the membership with `groups devone`.

- Step 4: Create and Secure the Project Directory

  Create a shared directory. By default, it will be owned by root.

  Bash

    ```
    mkdir /home/project_phoenix
    ```

  Now, change the group ownership to `project_phoenix` and set the permissions. A mode of `770` (`rwxrwx---`) gives the owner (`root`) and the group (`project_phoenix`) full access, while denying access to all others.

  Bash

    ```
    chgrp project_phoenix /home/project_phoenix
    chmod 770 /home/project_phoenix
    ```

- Step 5: Test the Permissions

  Log in as your new developer. They should be able to cd into the directory and create a file, proving the group permissions work.

  Bash

    ```
    login devone
    # (enter devone's password)
    cd /home/project_phoenix
    touch devone_report.txt
    ls
    ```

  You have successfully created a secure, collaborative workspace.

## 3. Advanced Workflows & Data Integrity

### Tutorial 3.1: Mastering the Pipeline

**Objective:** To find all log files in the system, count the number of errors in each, and output a sorted report. This tutorial demonstrates a powerful workflow using `find`, `xargs`, `grep`, and `sort`.

- Step 1: Find the Target Files

  Use the find command to locate all files ending in .log within your home directory.

  Bash

    ```
    find /home/Guest -name "*.log"
    ```

  This will output a list of paths, one per line.

- Step 2: Process Each File with xargs and grep

  Now, we'll pipe the output of find to xargs. xargs will take each line (each file path) and run a command on it. We'll use grep -c "ERROR" to count the occurrences of "ERROR" in each file.

  Bash

    ```
    find /home/Guest -name "*.log" | xargs grep -c "ERROR"
    ```

  The output will be a list of file paths, each followed by a number (e.g., `/home/Guest/data/logs/system.log:1`).

- Step 3: Sort the Results

  The output is useful, but not organized. Let's pipe the entire result to the sort command. Using the -n (numeric) and -r (reverse) flags, we can see the files with the most errors at the top.

  Bash

    ```
    find /home/Guest -name "*.log" | xargs grep -c "ERROR" | sort -nr
    ```

  You've just created a powerful one-line diagnostic tool by chaining simple, modular commands.


### Tutorial 3.2: Ensuring Data Integrity

**Objective:** To learn how to verify, transform, and protect your data using OopisOS's data integrity tools (`cksum`, `ocrypt`, and `base64`).

- **Step 1: Create a Secret Message**

  Bash

    ```
    echo "The obstacle is the way." > my_secret.txt
    ```

- Step 2: Get the Original Fingerprint

  Use cksum to generate a checksum, the unique "fingerprint" of your unaltered file. Note this number.

  Bash

    ```
    cksum my_secret.txt
    ```

- Step 3: Obscure and Encode the Data

  Obscure the file's content using ocrypt and encode it for safe transport using base64.

  Bash

    ```
    cat my_secret.txt | ocrypt "taco-tuesday" | base64 > safe_to_send.txt
    ```

- Step 4: Decode and Restore the Data

  To get the message back, reverse the process.

  Bash

    ```
    cat safe_to_send.txt | base64 -d | ocrypt "taco-tuesday" > restored_secret.txt
    ```

- Step 5: Verify the Integrity

  The final, crucial step. Run cksum on the restored file.

  Bash

    ```
    cksum restored_secret.txt
    ```

  The checksum number should be **identical** to the one from Step 2, proving with mathematical certainty that your data is intact. You have mastered the chain of data integrity.

## 4. The Creative & AI Suite

### Tutorial 4.1: Building Your First Adventure

**Objective:** To create a simple, two-room text adventure using the built-in `adventure` creation tool.

- Step 1: Launch the Adventure Creator

  Use the --create flag to enter the interactive creation mode.

  Bash

    ```
    adventure --create my_first_game.json
    ```

- Step 2: Create a Second Room

  You start in a default room. Let's create another one.

    ```
    (creator)> create room "A Dusty Attic"
    ```

  The creator will confirm the new room and automatically put you in "edit" mode for it.

- Step 3: Add a Description

  While in edit mode for the attic, set its description.

    ```
    (editing room 'A Dusty Attic')> set description "A small, dusty attic. A single window lets in a sliver of light."
    ```

- Step 4: Link the Rooms

  Exit edit mode by typing edit, then use link to create a two-way exit.

    ```
    (editing room 'A Dusty Attic')> edit
    (creator)> link "The Starting Room" north "A Dusty Attic"
    ```

- Step 5: Save and Play

  Save your work and exit the creator.

    ```
    (creator)> save
    (creator)> exit
    ```

  Now, play your creation!

  Bash

    ```
    adventure my_first_game.json
    ```


### Tutorial 4.2: Your AI Research Assistant

**Objective:** To use the `chidi` application to analyze a collection of documents and answer a complex question.

- Step 1: Prepare Your Corpus

  Ensure you have run the inflate.sh script, which creates a /docs directory full of Markdown files.

- Step 2: Launch Chidi

  Point chidi at the directory containing your research.

  Bash

    ```
    chidi /home/Guest/docs
    ```

- Step 3: Ask a Cross-File Question

  The chidi application will open. Use the dropdown to familiarize yourself with the files (command_reference.md, developer.md, etc.). Now, click the "Ask" button and type a question that requires information from multiple files:

  > "Based on the developer and command reference documents, explain how the 'Command Contract' ensures security."

- Step 4: Analyze the Result

  chidi will identify the most relevant documents, combine their content into a single context, and send it to the Gemini AI to synthesize an answer. It will then display the comprehensive answer in the main window.

- Step 5: Save Your Session

  Click the "Save" button. This will package the original documents and all of your AI-generated analysis into a single HTML file, creating a permanent, shareable artifact of your research.
